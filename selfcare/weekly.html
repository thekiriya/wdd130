            <h2> Helping you bloom, one week at a time. </h2>
          <p>
            The Weekly page breaks down self-care routines one can practice every week into three essential categories, 
            that is, body, mind, and environment. Simple physical self-care: like setting a hydration goal, trying a new 
            20-minute workout, cooking one healthy meal from scratch, or practicing a stretching routine before bed. These 
            tasks focus on physical wellness but don't leave one feeling very overwhelmed. Mental self-care includes journaling 
            to reflect one's emotions, making a gratitude list, a very little focused intention for the week, or time unplugged
             from social media. Perhaps even personal check-ins; brief mindful moments keeping one conscious of how they're 
             feeling and of what they need. Again, self-care for environments will encourage one to tidy one room or even just 
             one section of it, to take something reusable rather than single-use once, to make little changes that lessen
              waste, or preferably just go outside and experience. Such small practices piled up in a week will be quite
               powerful in improving one's life and surrounding bit by bit without those huge life changes.
