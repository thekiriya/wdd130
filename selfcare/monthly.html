          <p>
            The more comprehensive routines will be found on the monthly page for the interested self improver. 
            Monthly self-care can take various forms, a few being participating in a fitness challenge, reducing processed 
            foods, developing sleeping routine, or just trying out another movement form like yoga or dance. These are what 
            lead to building resilience and discipline, all the while being in connection with self-love. The mental aspect 
            of Monthly self-care routines may include everything from setting personal intentions to spending some time 
            reflecting upon patterns in their own lives for that month to interacting with any piece of literature that has 
            meaning for them and forgiving themselves and others. They might also spend time writing long letters to their 
            future selves and taking full weekends to rest without feeling guilty over it. People can also indulge in an 
            environmental aspect of self-care; this will be a task like decluttering a closet and donating what will not be
             used, putting together a compost bin, or volunteering for a care around their community. These are bigger
              decisions and require a bit of more thinking and time but give feelings of real impact and contribution, 
              even at the Monthly level. Self-care at the Monthly level would be taking a step back and viewing the larger
               scope and, by thoughtful and intentional direction, to choose who that person will be in the world.
